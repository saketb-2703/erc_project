				Motion planning is a fundamental research area in robotics. Numerous methods have been proposed to accomplish this task. However, the motion of car-like vehicles is constrained by their minimum turning radius, making it necessary to be considered during planning paths for such vehicles. In this talk by our alumni Mohit Gupta, We will briefly discuss the concept of continuity and visit many such algorithms starting from the very primitive to continuous curvature path planning techniques.

				It's amazing how you can make something as functional as a robotic arm at the same time as trivial as blinking an LED with the same board. With an Arduino the only limit is your imagination and thinking; you can make mind-blowing stuff happen. So let that current flow through the processor of your brain with Arduino Open, presented by CTE in association with ERC. Don't worry about hardware, we will be using TinkerCAD for the event. The event is for individual participants. Complete the tasks to win exciting prizes. <br>Prizes upto 5k

				This TechWeekend CTE brings ERC Talk on "Bio-inspired Robot Swarms" by our alumni Rishikesh Vanarse. Swarm Robotics draws inspiration from behaviours of birds and insects in nature to give a group of 'unintelligent' robots the ability to show intelligent behaviours through 'swarm intelligence' or 'collective decision-making algorithms.

                <h4 style="padding:0px !important; margin:0px !important;">18/01/2020</h4>
				<p>From interfacing microprocessors to making logical circuits, Robotics is incomplete without electronics. Every task that a Robot performs at the end eventually boils down to some signal received by it. In this session we will talk about various aspects of Electronics used in robotics including components like Arduino and microprocessor and PCB design.
                It aimed to give a overview about how Electronics being a very broad field itself becomes an integral part of Robotics. This session was also a part of the First demo lecture for our CTE course Introduction to Robotics.

				The word robot is derived from the word 'robota' which basically means labour. With purpose of making our lives easier, the first robot ever was created in 1950. Today we have come a long way where about a million robots are active worldwide in different fields. 
				The course is aimed at giving a kickstart to everyone who are interested in the field Robotics. The course will help you to get an idea about different aspects of robotics and also the new advancements in it.
                Topics covered include Arduino , PCB and ICs, Kinematics, Control Theory, Matlab & Simulink, Introduction to ROS amongst other things.

                <h4 style="padding:0px !important; margin:0px !important;">14/01/2020</h4>
				<p>
				Designing is fundamental to building a robot - it determines what capabilities your robot has, how easy it will be to assemble and control etc.… A well-designed robot should fit its use case well while being easy to program and minimizing cost. 
				This session aimed to introduce you to the underlying principles of robots' mechanical design, some of the latest developments in the field, and the tools used in the process, such as Solidworks and Fusion360. We aim to give you a big picture overview while also discussing how you can dive in.

				<p>
				Robots would be pretty useless without having the ability to act intelligently. Today, with ever more powerful machine learning techniques, robots are on their way to becoming truly intelligent. This session will give a broad overview of automation in robotics, covering topics from programming to AI.
				We discussed key concepts along the way and popular software frameworks (such as ROS and OpenCV, among others), making today’s rapid progress possible. The aim is to give a big picture overview of the current state of robot automation with a taste of the latest developments and how you can get started in this area.

				Robots have always captured the imagination of people; some look forward to having their C3PO and BB-8, while others picture a dystopian future ruled by robot overlords. Whatever it is, if robots fascinate you, you're not alone.
                We, at The Electronics and Robotics Club (ERC), are excited to hold an "Intro to ERC" session to throw light on the work that drives us, robotics enthusiasts. So if you're interested in the club, or robotics in general, do attend this short talk, where we hope to address all your queries.
